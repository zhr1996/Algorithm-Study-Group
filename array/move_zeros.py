Problem
-------------------
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Constraints
-------------------
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
* -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1

Thinking
-------------------
* if we are allowed to use extra space, we can make a new array of all non-zero numbers in original array and fill the rest of array with zero

*
