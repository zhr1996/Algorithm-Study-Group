Problem
-------------------
Given a positive integer n, return the number of the integers in the range [0, n] whose binary representations do not contain consecutive ones.

Constraints
-------------------
1 <= n <= 109

Thinking
-------------------
* Simple expression and few contraints always lead to hard problems
