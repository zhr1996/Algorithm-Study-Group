## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:

Collect all the leaf nodes.
Remove all the leaf nodes.
Repeat until the tree is empty.

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Thinking

- Seems this is very suitable for recursive methods

- This is the same with finding the depth of nodes: for example, leave has depth 0, so arr[0] has those leaves, and so on..

- Construct a dictionary containing depth as key and node as values. Then according to the max key, construct an array and store the node v \
  vale accordingly

## Summary

- Interesting problem! Think about tree depth next time encountered with tree problems

        from typing import List
        from collections import defaultdict


        class TreeNode:
            def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
                self.val = val
                self.left = left
                self.right = right


        def findLeaves(root: TreeNode) -> List[List[int]]:
            depth_dict = defaultdict(list)

            def dfs(node):
                if node.left is None and node.right is None:
                    depth_dict[0].append(node.val)
                    return 1

                left_depth = -1
                right_depth = -1

                if node.left:
                    left_depth = dfs(node.left)

                if node.right:
                    right_depth = dfs(node.right)

                cur_depth = max(left_depth, right_depth)
                depth_dict[cur_depth].append(node.val)

                return cur_depth + 1

            dfs(root)

            max_depth = max(depth_dict.keys())
            leave_arr = [[] for x in range(max_depth)]
            for key in depth_dict:
                leave_arr[key] = depth_dict[key]

            return leave_arr

        # if __name__ == "__main__":
        #     print(function)
