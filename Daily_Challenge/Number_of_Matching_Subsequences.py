''' The Problem
-------------------
Given a string s and an array of strings words, return the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of s.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= words.length <= 5000
1 <= words[i].length <= 50
s and words[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.


Thinking
-------------------
Brute force, for each word in word list, compare to see if it's a subsequence of s

Optimize 1: Use a hash map to check if the letters are the same (Time Out)
-------------------
Still don't work, example test case: word is "gp", s is 5*10^4 - 1 "g", and the last one is "p"

what makes hash map not enought to determine whether the word is a subsequence? the relative position of characters

How to memorize what characters we have checked and what position did we put it in ?

Optimize 2: Use a hashmap to store index of character of s, and use a pointer to point where we are matching s (Accepted)
-------------------
In this way, we can check if there is next char available in s quickly. The way we achieve this is using binary search.

In python, bisect can be used to find a num in list using binary search

Note:
-------------------
* index_s should start from -1. Since we are ensuring each found index greater than the index_s

Time complexity: O(len(words) * len(word) * log(len(s)))

Tag: Moderate, if think of store index list in a hashmap and using binary search to find the index in index_list, then would be easy
A combination of hashmap and binary search.
