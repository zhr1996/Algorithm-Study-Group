# Algorithms

This repo has the solution for the Online Problems I have learned and solved. I originally wanted to form a group, but it turns out I am the only contributor. But I don't want to change the name so the repo is called algorithm study group. Solving leetcode is so much fun, I can't wait to get up each to put myself into one problem.

The problems are categorzied into folders. I have also write some blogs to explain my thinking process while solving these problems. 

For now, I am mainly following Leetcode Daily Challenge. Check my blog [here](https://zhr1996.github.io/)
